Example prompts to reproduce:

- I need a minimal start page with a neumorphic design. The user should be able to add individual tiles to the page and assign them a custom link without modifying the code. When a tile is clicked, it opens its custom link.

- The user should be able to add links without modifying the code.

- The tiles should be squares, evenly spaced, and centered on the page. 

- The links should also be centered on each tile. I need the page to remember what tiles the user has added through cookies.

- When a tile is deleted, its link should also be removed from the cookie.
